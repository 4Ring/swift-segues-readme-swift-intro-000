## Learning Objectives - The student should be able to..

* Fill this out when lesson is written.


## What the student can do at this point 

* Create variables and constants
* Is familiar with type annotations, type inference and string interpolation.
* Can create functions with return types.
* Is familiar with the String, Int, Double, and Bool type.
* Can perform arithmetic operations on Int and Double.
* Understands if and else clause statements.
* Can create and use Arrays.
* Can iterate over an Array using a for-in loop.
* Can iterate over an Array calling enumerate().
* Work with the following methods on arrays:
	* append()
	* insert(_:atIndex:)
	* removeAtIndex()
	* subscript syntax with arrays
	* count
	* isEmpty
* Can work with dictionaries 
* Can iterate over a dictionary
* Knows how to work with optionals
* Classes
* Structs
* Properties

## Outline / Notes

*  These are [slides](http://imgur.com/a/baEqp) I created for a lecture given on `UINavigationController` and how to work with `UIStoryboardSegue` and the prepareForSegue method. You can reference these notes, but I think the language I used might bee too complicated for the students of this course (maybe not).
* I think it's important for the student to visualize what the segue is, what it's doing, and how we can pass information forward to another `UIViewController`. In the immersive course here, this particular topic trips up a lot of people. We need to be very clear, concise, explicit and treat it as if we're explaining it to a five year old.
* I think my slide above that breaks down the prepareForSegue method is good to show them, as it outlines in a visual format what the hell is going on. But this will need to be backed by a thorough explanation.
* Include an xcode project that has a list of food emoji's where when one is tapped, it will segue over to another `UIViewController` which displays the selected emoji much larger in the center of the screen.
